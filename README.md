1)  ## Simple password manager 
Allows users to create accounts, log in, and checks the strength of passwords. uses argon2 library for hashing passwords and JSON for storage. I included this one because I think that argon2 is neat, especially because it is much more resistant than sha2 type hashing to decryption attacks through some interesting techniques like parallelism to basically load the cpu, gpu, ram and the other parts of a cracking rig.
